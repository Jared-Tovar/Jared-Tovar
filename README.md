- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
  I'm starting my coding career through The Odin Project, and I've found it so far to be a great resource to introduce 
me to concepts of html. Soon we'll be starting CSS and up to this point I have enjoyed everything TOP has made me do. 
I'm learning at a fast pace and it's exciting to say the least. I'm super optimistic to see where this journey leads. 
I made a promise to myself to keep my foot on the pedal and learn as much as I can. I'm fully aware that I'm starting
way behind everyone else, but I won't be slowing down and I'm devoting myself to this industry, whereever that brings me.
